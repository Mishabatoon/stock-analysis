# All Stocks Analysis

## Overview of Project

This project is an analysis of All Stock Tickers for the year 2017 and 2018 using VBA and excel. The exercises in this project were to analyze a defined list of stocks using VBA (particularly `For` loops and `If`/`Then` statements) to iterate over the data to calculate Daily Volume and Returns. The last part of the exercise was to include a code that computes how quickly the code was executed.
